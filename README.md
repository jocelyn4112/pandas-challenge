Heroes of Pymoli - Takeaway Analysis

Heroes of Pymoli - Takeaway Analysis

1) Not surprisingly given the industry, the majority of players making in-game purchases are male (84.03%) and ages 20-24 and 15-19, with  63.37% of purchases made by these ages total. 

2) Women and Other/Non Disclosed players spend more. The average purchase price throughout the game is $3.05, with men spending $3.02 versus $3.20 and $3.34 for women and others respectfully. While these two groups represent only 15.97% of purchases, they show more of a propensity to spend and potential for increased in game purchases, along with marketings towards expanding these demographics in general.

3) #As an assumption, I am equating price to profitability, without considering COGS. In this situation, the cost per unit would be nominal however R&D and general overhead costs are needed for a more complete profitability analysis.# Marketing, promotion,  and advertising should be directed at items that are current strong performers, being both popular and profitable. In this case, "Final Critic" and "Outbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm". Rising stars, such as 'Fiery Glass Crusader" and "Extraction, Quickblade of Tremblinghands" should be highlighted and concentrated upon as the next generation of revenue leaders based on current metrics and indicated trends as to matain revenue.
